# D_Flip_Flop-design-and-veriication-using-UVM
This project aims to verify D flip flop using UVM. The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is a standardized methodology for verifying digital designs using SystemVerilog. It provides a framework of reusable verification components (UVCs) and promotes a structured approach to building testbenches.
